**Important:**
Google Play Protect may warn that QuickTiles is a "harmful app."
This is a false positive. You can check the full source code in this repository — there is no
malicious activity.<br>
If you disable Play Protect, Android may still periodically show warnings. This seems to be because
Android stores previously detected warnings and repeats them, even after Play Protect is turned off.
